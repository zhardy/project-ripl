  * Potentially table format
* Costs
  * Be more specific
* Answer questions
  * Will a user's friends be imported from another site? Or would your friends already need to be on FeedMe for you to be able to see their information?
  * Is this for mobile and desktop?
  * How will you differentiate? Consider looking into Pulse. It's an app I have used that came to mind upon reading your proposal.   * Also, if I link my SoundCloud, Spotify, (insert other media app here), to Facebook, it will display some of my friend's activity... Something to think about when considering the success of an application. Again, these aren't things that need to be addressed here, but they are definitely questions you will want to know the answer to if you don't already.
* add archived things to Done section on trello!
* Git safety: `add`, `commit`, `pull`, `push` in that order
