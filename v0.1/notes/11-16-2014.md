## Hackathon!!
* Code all day

**Front-end:**
* Used jQuery to modify style using the color wheel and algorithms
* Set up routes and views for login and account creation
* Bug fixing
* Linked feeds to main page: feeds are rendering

**Back-end:**
* Created database schema
* Added all connectors to the database
* Able to add, remove, and get all data needed for the system
* Tested all connectors to make sure they return correct data

## Discussion
* Meeting tomorrow with graphic design club - 8pm 11/17
* Meeting friday with potential developers for next semester - 7pm 11/21

## Tasks
* update changelog on changes
* set up user authentication and logins
* Fix scrolling bug on main page

## Comments
* makes more sense to have color wheel choose the color for the background of the stories, rather than the background of the page
