## Discussion
* Getting to work on Project 4
* Fixing errors in Project 3
* __Nav bar modifications__
  * New nav bar will expand when clicked to reveal new functionality, rather than having all functions visible
* __Database management__
  * Working feed is working again
  * Feed uses jQuery to get RSS entries
* Meeting tomorrow (Monday) for more work
* Potential 'hackathon' event next Sunday where we will work for many hours in a row to get much work done

## Tasks
* Continue coding
* Functional spec document in good (better) shape
* Need better understanding of project 4 - maybe ask for clarification from professor
