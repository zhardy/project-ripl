* Feed - a feed is a continuously updated list of items from different sources. These items could be text, image, music, etc. Users have the ability to filter their feeds to include items from different sources/types of media.

*	Feeder - the profile of another user is called a Feeder. A user has the ability to subscribe to and unsubscribe from Feeders, allowing the user to see their feed. They can also silence specific sources from the Feeder's feed.

* Filter - a Filter is a feature that allows a user to add or remove sources from a feed. These filters are saved so that a user can have different feeds for different purposes (news, multimedia, etc.).

* Silence - Silencing is a feature that allows a user to stop a source from broadcasting to the Feeders that follow them as well as stopping a source from a Feeder's feed from broadcasting to the user.

* Source - a Source is something that contributes to a user's feed, such as a webcomic or news RSS. A user can subscribe/unsubscribe from a source as well as filter specific sources out of their feed.
